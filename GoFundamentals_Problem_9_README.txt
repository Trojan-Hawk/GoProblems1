						Task:
	Write a program that prints the current time and date to 
						the console.
	
					  Procedure:
Start by creating a .go file.
Open the command prompt and navigate to the .go file directory.
Open up the .go file in a text editor.
Start by declaring the package name, in this it will be 'main'.
Then import the 'fmt' and the 'math' package.
The format package alllows us to call format on any print lines we have.

First we call the main function.
Then declare a variable with a value of 20 and an empty guess variable.
Then we run a for loop which calls a square root function,
the loop ends when the function returns the same value.

The squareRoot function uses Newton's method of approximating a square root.
Equation: (((x * x) - x) / (2 * x))
 
After the loop the approximate square root and the actual square root are output.
