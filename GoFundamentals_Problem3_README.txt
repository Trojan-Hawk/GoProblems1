Start by creating a .go file.
Open the command prompt and navigate to the .go file directory.
Open up the .go file in a text editor.
Start by declaring the package name, in this it will be 'main'.
Then import the 'fmt' package.
The format package alllows us to call format on any print lines we have.
First we call the main function.
We then run call a for loop that runs 100 times.
Inside the loop is an if statement that prints out something to the console
depending on the value of i.
If i is divisable by 3 and 5, 'FizzBuzz' is output.
If i is divisable by 3, 'Fizz' is output.
If i is divisable by 5, 'Buzz' is output.
And if i is none of the above the value for i is output.
