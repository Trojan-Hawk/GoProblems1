Start by creating a timeAndDate.go file.
Open the command prompt and navigate to the .go file directory.
Open up the .go file in a text editor.
Start by declaring the package name, in this it will be 'main'.
Then import the 'fmt' and the 'time' packages.
The format package alllows us to call format on any print lines we have.
The time package allows us to access the system clock.
First we call the main function.
Then we store the current system time and date in a variable called curTimeDate.
Next we call the function to display the hours, minutes and 
seconds from this variable on a formatted print line.
We then call the function to display the day, month and 
year from this variable on a formatted print line.
