						Task:
	Write a function that returns the largest and smallest 
				elements in a list.
	
					  Procedure:
Start by creating the .go file.
Open the command prompt and navigate to the .go file directory.
Open up the .go file in a text editor.

Start by declaring the package name, in this it will be 'main'.
Then in the main we import the 'fmt' package.
The format package alllows us to call format on any print lines we have.

First we call the main function.
Inside this we declare our variables and create an int array.
Then the array is output to the console.

After this is a for loop which is controlled by the length of the array.
Inside this loop we check for the smallest and largest in the array and
store them into variables.

When the loop has ended the smallest and largest number in the array 
are output, then the program terminates.
