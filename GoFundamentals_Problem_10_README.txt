						Task:
	Write a program that prints the current time and date to 
						the console.
	
					  Procedure:
Start by creating a .go file.
Open the command prompt and navigate to the .go file directory.
Open up the .go file in a text editor.
Start by declaring the package name, in this it will be 'main'.
Then import the 'fmt' package.
The format package alllows us to call format on any print lines we have.

First we call the main function.
Then we declare two string variables.
Next we populate one of these variables with user input.
We then store the length of the input string in a variable.

Next we have a loop which uses the string length as a control.
This loop stores the last character of the user input string into
a new string and continues doing this while moving left along the 
string until the length is reached.
After the loop the user input string and the reversed string are output.
